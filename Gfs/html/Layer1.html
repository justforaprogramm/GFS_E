        <h3>Important:</h3>
        first I give you an Information which is important.<br>
        a computer only can make a difference between on and off.<br>
        whats the language and you maybe now it with the name "binary".<br>
        binary-language is a language whith only two letters. most common 0 and 1.

        The first Layer is the physikal Layer. It only can transfer bits from one to another system.<br>
        You don't realy now from which system the bit comes and all connectors in the network 
        become the bit.<br>you can transfer the bit with all kind of transfer medium.<br>
        If you want you can use your bare hands to transfer the bit via handsignal.<br>
        But nowadays The computer use electrons in difference voltage, to difference 0 and 1.<br>
